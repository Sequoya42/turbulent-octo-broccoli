7 philosophers

Each own its own thread

A stick to the left of each one(7 total)

They can use a stick if its is free(to the left or right of them)

2 philo cannot use the same stick at the same time

3 steps for each philo:

-Eats with two stick (left and right)
-Rest, without sticks, even if available.
-Think. With one and only one stick in hand

After rest, he can either eat or think.
If a neighbour think, he can get his stick stolen.

A philo who does not eat loose 1 HP per sec.

After eating, he get all his HP back and get to rest.

If HP = 0, he dies.
